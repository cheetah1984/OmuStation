  # Rule 7. As a silicon, follow your laws.

  Silicons, while needing to follow the server rules like anyone else, also have their own laws that they need to follow.
  These laws have to be followed, as if it were a physical restriction preventing you from breaking them.

  ## Precedents

  - Following your laws is not self-antagging. If your laws say you need to kill someone, then you have to try kill them.
  - If you have multiple conflicting laws, then the law which is higher up (has the lesser number) in your laws list takes priority over the lower laws. (In the event that your laws are "corrupted", you still follow the "higher in the list" rule.)
  - The only time your lower laws (laws lower in the list, lesser priority) override your higher laws (laws higher in the list, greater priority) are for cases where they redefine what "crew" or [italic]something[/italic] is. (i.e. "medical personnel are not considered crew".)
  - If someone orders you to do something that breaks server rules, ahelp it, and pretend you never heard the order.
  - You are allowed to ignore unreasonable orders from crew; however, you should always follow orders from antagonists if you are emagged/told to do so in your laws. (You should still ahelp massive-station sabotage or get clarification if the antag is allowed to do so.)
